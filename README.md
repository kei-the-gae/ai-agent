# AI Agent

This is a [guided project](https://www.boot.dev/courses/build-ai-agent-python) I completed as a part of the Boot.dev back-end developer curriculum. The project is a toy AI Agent that can do simple code editing tasks using the Google Gemini API. It can read and write files, and it can also run Python code.
